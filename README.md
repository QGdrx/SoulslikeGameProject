Here's a project I'm working on in my spare time on Unreal Engine 5.4.
It's a Soulslike game with an original lore that I'm writing outside the project, so if you ever need more information, don't hesitate to contact me on discord: falkoof or by mail: quentingdrpro@gmail.com.

It features several classic game systems such as : 
- a life bar system for the player and enemies
- a sprint system (for running, uses endurance)
- an endurance system
- a mana system (not completely finished, but based on the same principle as the life bar)
- a lock-on system, which locks the camera on a particular enemy
- an interaction system, allowing you to interact with NPCs and objects
- a dialogue system, which lets you interact with NPCs to talk to them (already contains dubbing done by myself (I'm very bad at dubbing))
- a translation system: two languages are already available: English and French
- a menu system
- a save system (temporary but functional)

Obviously I'm adding things regularly, so it's possible that there will be other systems in addition to these.
